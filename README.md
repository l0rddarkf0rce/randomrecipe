# randomrecipe
I took Mariya's (Python Simplified YouTube Channel https://www.youtube.com/@PythonSimplified) idea of a random recipe picker app and turned it into a python/Flask/HTML app.

The default port when you run the program is 5000 but this can be easily changed.

## Dependencies
* flask
* sqlite3
* random
